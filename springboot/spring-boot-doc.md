### SpringBoot

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run"

**Features**

* Create stand-alone Spring applications
* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
* Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
* Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

### Why Spring

* Microservices
* Reactive
* Cloud
* Web Apps
* Serverless
* Event Driven
* Batch
