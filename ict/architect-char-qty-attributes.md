**Availability:**  The availability quality attribute is the measure of how the system or a component is to be used when needed.

An example of availability would be the uptime of a website, the responsiveness of a customer service system, or the reliability of an online payment system.

**Fault Tolerance:** The fault tolerance quality attribute is the measure of how to continue to operate despite the occurrence of faults.

An example of fault tolerance would be the redundancy of a power grid, the error handling of a computer program, or the fail-safe design of a manufacturing system.

**Recoverability:** The recoverability quality attribute is the measure of how to return to a known state after a failure.

#### Security

Security describes the extent to which a system or a component meets that only authorized users are able to access data or services.

**Confidentiality:** The confidentiality quality attribute is the measure of how sensitive information is kept secure and only accessed by authorized individuals.

**Integrity:** The integrity quality attribute is the measure of how data or services are complete, accurate, and reliable.

**Non-repudiation:** The non-repudiation quality attribute is the measure of how an individual or entity cannot deny having performed a particular action.

**Accountability:** The accountability quality attribute is the measure of how the actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to the entity.

An example of accountability would be an organization that may have a policy that requires employees to log in using their own credentials in order to be held accountable for their actions.

**Authenticity:** The authenticity quality attribute is the measure of how the data or services are genuine and reliable.

An example of authenticity would be a software application that may use digital certificates to verify the authenticity of the data it processes.

#### Maintainability

Maintainability describes the extent to which a system or a component meets to be supported, debugged, updated, and modified.

**Modularity:** The modularity quality attribute is the measure of how dividing a system into separate, independent components. This allows each component to be tested, debugged, and modified separately, making the system as a whole easier to maintain.

An example of modularity would be a system or a component one where functions and classes are organized into separate modules that can be easily replaced, added, or removed from the system.

**Reusability:**  The reusability quality attribute is the measure of how a system or a component allows being used in multiple applications and contexts.

An example of reusability would be a system or a component with functions and classes that can be reused in different applications and can save time and effort when developing new software.
